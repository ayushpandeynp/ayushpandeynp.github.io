### Project Name
***
Our project is called 12 Candles, inspired by the teen movie 16 Candles where every candle represents a wish. In our story, each candle is a request from the spiritual energy. Although our theme is very different, we liked the idea of connecting our project to a well-known teen movie, making an interesting contrast.

### Project Description
***
Our project is a web-based audio-visual experience. When we were brainstorming for ideas, we realized that even though we all dislike getting scared, we're also really drawn to horror stories. We found that the thrill of being scared actually keeps us more engaged. So, we decided to go with a horror theme for our story to keep everyone on the edge of their seats. 

Candles are a staple in horror stories, often used for eerie rituals like calling upon spirits. While brainstorming, we humorously reminisced about the movie Sixteen Candles from 1984, where a young girl gets 16 candles for her 16th birthday, with each candle symbolizing a wish. We loved the idea of paying homage to that movie but with a twist, turning it into something entirely different. That's how "12 Candles" came to be. In our story, each of the 12 candles stands for a request from the supernatural, giving a nod to the classic film while taking our narrative into the realm of horror.

To make the experience as immersive as possible, we used lots of ambient noises, sounds from objects, and conversations. For instance, for the part in the story where books fall from the shelf, we recorded the sound of a real book dropping to make the audio feel immersive. 

The visuals on our website go hand in hand with the audio to bring the story to life. We added them to enhance the listening experience by providing something for the audience to see, making the whole experience more complete. This combination of sight and sound helps immerse the viewer in the story, making every moment more vivid and memorable. 

We also wanted to add a layer of interactivity to the experience. The idea of the whole experience being accompanied with a minigame was brought forth. Everyone loved the idea, so we decided to add a drag-and-drop mini-game alongside the audio experience. This added a new layer of engagement, making the entire experience more hands-on and immersive for the audience.

### Process
***
To bring this story to life, we structured our story into distinct elements of narration and acting, with Sonny assuming the role of narrator while Ayush, Stefan, and Avinash became sound actors. Utilizing professional-grade recording equipment, such as the Zoom H6 audio recorder, we recorded dialogues and sound effects, later refining them with enhancements like reverb, equalization, and compression using Audacity. We also found some free-to-use stock audio effects from YouTube that fit our story perfectly. 

After we finalized the story recording and editing, we moved on to planning the web integration. Our team divided the story up into segments, and started to plan the additional components that complete the experience. To add a visual component, we first employed stable diffusion models like DALL·E and MidJourney to generate character sheets. We then used Adobe Photoshop to select these characters from their sheets and place them within their appropriate backgrounds, such as a living room, or a basement.

To synchronize the visuals and interactive elements on the website with the audio narrative, we employed JQuery and JavaScript. This allowed us to precisely time when certain visuals would appear in relation to the audio playback. For instance, when Tariq's voice is heard 37 seconds into the audio, an image of Tariq speaking would appear on the screen. This effect was achieved using a mix of callback functions and timers, ensuring that the visual representation matched the audio cues perfectly.

### Reflection/Evaluation
***
Looking back, we really didn't know how it would turn out at the start. We wanted to blend the fun vibe of "16 Candles" with our own horror twist, and honestly, it was a bit of a shot in the dark.

Surprisingly, everything came together better than we hoped. The scary parts of our story ended up being really gripping, and adding real-life sound effects made the experience super realistic. The visuals and the mini-game we added on the website also turned out to be great, making everything feel more interactive.

Getting the timing right for the audio and visuals to match up was tough, but we figured it out and it made a huge difference. Seeing a character speak at the exact moment their voice came through the speakers was pretty cool.

All in all, "12 Candles" turned out to be something we're all proud of. We managed to create a unique experience that was both engaging and fun, way beyond what we initially thought was possible. It just goes to show what you can achieve when you mix different ideas and work together as a team.
