# Grand Theft Auto: Meow City

### Introduction
The project is inspired by the Grand Theft Auto series by Rockstar Games. As Sonny's and my video was centered around cats, I wanted to create a storyline where cats go on a mission in my version of the GTA – Meow City. While navigating through the story, users are given opportunities to interact with the website.

### Story
The story starts with Ayush and Sonny chatting about a heist to steal a Van Gogh painting that is being brought to the NYUAD campus soon. They will get caught if they try to perform the heist themselves, as they will easily be spotted through the security cameras. So, Ayush comes up with the idea of using cats to steal the painting.

They plant mind-control chips on 3 cats, and control them from their dorms. When the painting arrives at the NYUAD Welcome Center, the delivery guys need to check in before they can proceed to the High Security Storage at the Campus Center (C2). Taking this opportunity, Ayush and Sonny send Cat 1 to distract the security guards guarding the delivery vehicle. Cat 2 and 3 sneak into the vehicle and steal the painting, then all 3 cats run away through the basement to deliver the painting to Ayush and Sonny's apartment. This ends the heist.

### Implementation
- Created a storyline document.
- Generated images required for the story by using DALL·E, an AI image generator based on text input.
- Built the wireframe and user interface on Adobe XD.
- Wrote HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the idea come true.

### Reflection
Reflecting on the project, I think this project successfully met its goals of creating an engaging and interactive storyline centered around a cat-themed heist. The use of AI-generated images helped a lot in shaping the aesthetics. The user interface also significantly contributed to the overall appeal of the game. While there may have been challenges in balancing humor with plot coherence, I am proud of what it turned out to be. I think it provides an entertaining experience for users while reading the story.
